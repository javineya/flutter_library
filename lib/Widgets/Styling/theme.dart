  The Theme widget has two important uses:
    1. To give the app an overall theme.
    2. To give different themes to its child.

  Importantly, the app-wide theme lives in the root of the app in main.dart.
  You will see this in action if you look there.

  The Theme widget in this file will be used to show the #2 usage, and give a
   different theme to its child container.
